                                                          Rural market rates surveys tend to reflect lower rates than the metro-based market rates surveys. It is hard for rural providers to raise their rates to be even comparable to metro-based cc provider rates, because, once they do, they may loose families to unlicensed care, as parents arent' accustomed to paying higher rates.  It is important to raise the issue of the cost of cc to the general public.

The additional effort to access all providers would not be great compared to the effort in only reaching a sample.  The office has in past years been in a Sate of Flux with new databases being introduced, changed and so on, but I believe our energies would be better placed attempting to obtain the data and place it in our day in day out database.  This would eliminate the need for a contractor, and conserve internal resources as well, and allow the data more widespread and easier accessability.   10000   10000                                                In a very small population state like ours, attempting to reach the whole population rather than sampling may prove more efficient and effective. Our entire universe of providers may in many instances be much smaller than the samples drawn in larger population states.                                                                                                                                                          8750           28750Assumes about 2 months' worth of Research Analyst time ($10,000) and the sum of other peoples' efforts in the Division to be equal to the time of the Research Analyst.

Could include family child care providers that are located on a base.       2       1       3In fact their is just one .  Partcipation in the survey is voluntary and they could have chosen not to participate.          There is just 1 Indian reservation in Alaska and it has 1 center, which is in the data set. Tribal Organizations provide their own subsidies to providers. Some Tribes certify their own providers, but if a provider cares for more than 4 children and any one of the children is not a relative of the provider, the provider is regulated by the state.       0                                                                     Alaska is unusual in that it has Native Corporations and Tribal Organizations, rather than reservations. The only Indian reservation that exists has its providers subject to state regulation.The universe of providers in Alaska would be a small sample for many other states. Our methodology would not perhaps withstand the rigors that someone else might impose. Given the very small number of providers, the methodology of calling a provider N times, at a variety of times of day/days of the week, and then abandoning efforts after N times would have resulted in a very small sample (unless N was set at infinite), because our contractor would have exhausted his list of potential respondents very quickly with very few responders. Effort was spent beyond that to increase the number of completed surveys, but such efforts might be interpreted as giving certain respondents greater weight in the survey (a higher probability of having been captured), but the alternative would have been a very small sample size and many cells (by region and provider type) with little or no data.       1                                                                                                                                                       -1       1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0The survey was not piloted per se, but the methodology was essentially the same as in prior years. The 2005 contractor had done the work in at least one prior year. The questions were essentially the same as the year before, although the survey was much shorter, i.e., many questions were deleted from the prior year's survey.      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                                  0                                                                                                                                                                                    753      27     316     410      -1                                                                                                                                                                                            1               1Prior to the survey commencing, providers were notified by the Child Care Program Office via postcard and encouraged to partcipate.Only 27 providers explicitly refused to participate.  105 others had disconnected phones, said it was the wrong number, said they were no longer in business, did not speak english...etc    That leaves 211 for whom either there was never an answer to the phone calls (rings but no answering machine or person ever answers), messages were left but no call backs, the person said call again over and over or said they would call back and did not.  Although this counts 4 providers for whom their was no phone number in our database.    I conted 211-4=207 plus 27 explicit refusals as non responders, so 410/644 is our response rate.    Of course, some of the 234 Non respondents are in fact no longer in business and should not have been part of the sample/universe.  Some of the 109 that I say should not have been part of the sample, were actually in fact just refusing to participate.20050628Not sure what the discrepancy between this question and A3.  6/28/05 is the postmark on the email from the providerthat contained the final survey data, which from my point of view was when it was completed.  I would speculate that they may well have conducted their last survey somewhat earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       4       1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Small providers (licensed homes) might complete the survey in a few minutes. Large facilities might take a good deal longer. The contractor initially estimated about 15 minutes per survey, but found it was frequently taking longer, sometimes much longer for the bigger providers. In addition to questions regarding rates, our survey asked questions about employees. And so, for homes with just an owner operator, the survey was quite short. Centers frequently needed to gather information, and may well have spent more time than the length of the phone conversation would suggest.       1The range from high to low within each category was checked.  The principle problem expected was that some full time and part time rates might have been mixed in with eachother, due to the perceptions of the providers about what is full/part time varying from ours.  Also data was checked to make sure Full>=part>=day>=hour...howevre there is no requirement that part time say be half the full time rate, or a day 1/30th the monthly et al...in fact shorter units of care tend to have higher, and frequently very much higher, costs when one calculates out the equivalency on a full month full time basis.  Many providers are tring to steer clients into utilising conventional units of care, typically a full months enrollment, and rates for smaller/erratic units are frequently punitive to discourage their use.

Various other questions not related to rates were asked, and typically would be reported with the provider as the unit of measurement.    We stratified our sample by provider type, and data is frequently reported by type: Center, Group Home, Licensed Home.       0       0       1       0       0                                                                                                                                                                                 1       1       1       1       1       1      -1       1       1       1       0       0       1       0       1       1       0       1I indicate no above, but to some extent we will analyze data on a statewide level, especially non-rate related questions. We possess enough information (we know the county and zip codes of the respondents) and could analyze the data in other ways.                                                                                                                                                                         14 hours or less, or by provider definition.                                                                                      0                                                                                         0       0       0       0       0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Rates are set by region, and so a community that previously had no providers would still have its rates determined based on the region in which it was located.    Analysis based on quality, eduaction and other matter, including rates over time may be done from time to time, but it is not per se a part of the market rate Survey, but rather Market rate Survey in combination with other data would be used for such analysis.       0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Questions were asked in standardised units.                                                                                                                                                              1Routinely, based on the percentile rank of State rates within the data.    i.e. if the state rate was below that of 5 providers and above that of 5 providers the stae rate would be at the 50th percentile, and we would consider that a measure of accessibality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               State rates tend to have dropped below the 50th percentile at this point.               The percentile ranking of the state rates serves as a measure of market access for subsidy children.                                                                                                                0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I have mentioned the issue of our relatively small Universe of Providers, but that issue is a problem endemic in Alaska data do to our small population.  For many instances even switching to total universe reporting doe not solve the problem.  Since the problem is one endemic in Alaska's small poulation, I do not neccessarily view it as a methodological issue.                                                                                                                    0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0We hope to switch to universe reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1                                                                                                                                                                 1health.hss.state.ak.us/dpa/programs/ccare                                                        -1       1Email                                                                                                                                                                                                        -1       1       1       1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                Our data could go onto our website at some time, but has not and historically has not.  Our reports, or at least some of them, will essentially be available to the public, in practical terms the only people we target to reach an are sure we do reach are our R&R, LA's and providers; in the case of the latter, it tends to be the larger providers taking an active interest.    Other groups are in general welcome to have access to information, and we would love to be reaching more people so as to educate them on childcare issues, but in practical terms the contact with people outside of the 'Childcare Community' is not good.  This is not because this office wishes to withhold information, but a reflection of the low priority our society places on childcare issues.20010701

                                       Comment to response to Q# D1: No-fee centers were excluded from the survey and therefore also excluded from the rate analysis.    Comments to responses to Q#D3:  Regions included county clusters as well as individual counties in some instances.

Comments to Q# D4: Rates in limited markets such as rural areas were analyzed not separately; but were indeed analyzed due to the very nature of our state's geographic regions.                                                                                                                             1                                                                                                                                                                 1www.de.state.az.us/childcare/survey.asp                                                           1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                              1      -1       1       1       1       1Advocacy groups; Libraries; Financial institutions (for lending/loan determinations); courts (for child support order matters)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   20011001                                                                               0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1       1       1       1       1       1       1       1       1E       C       I                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Desire to not have waiting list (and not reduce income or other eligibility factors to artificially cut program demand).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0       0       1       0       0                                                                                                                                                                                                               1       1       1       1       1       1      -1       1       1       1       0       0       0       0       1Certain relatives (e.g. grandparents, aunts/uncles) may provide care, be unregulated and receive subsidies on behalf of eligible families.

General survey comments:  It would have been convenient to have a comment section available after every question.    It would be helpful to be able to go back to the beginning of a section with a single key stroke as opposed to having to page back one page at a time.    For individuals who were inputting/responding to more than one section, it would have been convenient to only have to 'log in' once as opposed to multiple times for each section.    Question?  Since a 'Field-Test Version' (such as this) was completed, will it be necessary to complete another survey when it goes out to all states?

There may be more than one price profile per county, but only one price profile per ZIP. Larer counties will have several profiles, while smaller counties may only have one or two. There will be seperate profiles for center based care and for family child care homes. Trustlined/relative care will be based on a percentage of the familiy child care home rates.       1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1                                                                                                                                                                -1www.dhs.dc.gov                                                                                   -1       1Dept. of Education Letter to voucher contractors (Alternative Payment Programs) and to Family Child Care Home Networks subject to the RMR Survey (8/29/03), All-County Ltr (ACL 03-41) to CWDs 9/8/03        -1       1       1      -1      -1       1Voucher contractors (Alternative Payment Programs), FCCH Networks subject to the RMR Survey, and county welfare departments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      20031001                                                                               2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   4Comparing full-time monthly ceiling changes for centers:  -Average increase of 2.1%  -52.5% had a decrease, while 37.7% had an increase.

There is only a part-time hourly ceiling, that is set by dividing the full-time weekly by 45 hours, with a minimum of at least $2.00/hour. The "ceiling" is the maximum reimbursement per category for subsidized child care.

Weekly rates were most prevalent.  When daily rates were not provided, weekly full-time rates were divided by 5 (days per week), and/or monthly full-time rates were divided by 20 (5 days per week, 4 weeks per month), and/or hourly full-time rates were multiplied by 10 (hours per day), to yield a calculated daily full-time rate.  In the event that more than one rate was calculated (e.g., if the provider reported both full-time weekly and monthly rates) but the calculated rates did not agree, the daily rate calculated from the weekly rate was given first precedence as the rate used in analyses, the daily rate calculated from the monthly rates was given second precedence, and the daily rate calculated from the hourly rate was given third precedence. There were a few exceptions to these rules.  In the event that a center provided full-time care for 4 days per week, the denominators for calculating daily from weekly and monthly rates was based on 4, not 5 days per week.  In the event that a center provided care for 35 or more hours per week and provided care for 4 or more days per week and accepted children only full-time but did not report full-time rates, part-time rates were substituted for full-time rates, and the conversion formulas described were applied to obtain a daily full-time rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                         0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Market Rate Survey information was used for another report to estimate child care accessibility.  The 'Illinois Child Care Rates Report' is available at www.dhs.state.il.us/ts/ccfs/ccd/childcarereports.asp       11. Proper ID of outlying rates (ie- appropriate exclusion of rates that lie outside of 'reasonable' rates in the given geographical area/market. 2. The conversion of rates reported hourly, weekly, or monthly to a standard FT rate. Issues involved how many hours per day, days per week, days per month to use as a multiplier or denominator when converting to FT rates. 3. The conversion issue was a particular one when converting Before and After school programs to a daily full time rate given that BA programs are not by defenition full time. 4. While analysis at the slot level seems most appropriate, current analysis suggest that for family child care homes, analysis at the provider-by-age group level might be as valid or more valid. 5. Lower than desired data update rates by a few participating CCR&Rs.         1Analysis and reporting of rates was based at the slot level exclusively

2)The strict utilization of daily FT rates as the standard mode is under consideration as a)at least the plurality of provider charge and report weekly rates; and b) conversion or rates to one standard introduces error. 3)Analysis of center rates may continue at the slot level whereas analysis of family child care rates may be conducted at the level of the provider for a particular age group.  4) We will conduct an analysis to see if providers not reporting rates and providers who were not contacted to update rates are different in important dempographic characteristics from those for whom rates are available.

This gave us valid data without the expense of a survey or the possible bias created when providers know they are providing information for rate setting at the state level. The audit department in the Lead Agency, Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services analyzed the data, prepared the survey and the results/report.       0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            5       5       5The rates collected were very accurate as they are the ones the public receives when referred to providers.  The cost was much lower than paying for a contractor as no survey needed to be designed and sent and the analysis was done with existing staff in another division within the agency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       999999Unable to provide this information as existing staff was used at both the KACCRRA and state agency & I have no way of factoring out the expense of the time spent on this survey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1286634       1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       -1      -1       1      -1                                                  -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                            -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1       1       1       1      -1       1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                                 2    7283       1                                                                                                                                                                              Data included only Family Child Care Providers and Child Care Centers.

About 50% of providers have returned a questionnaire within the current survey year.  All reported fee information is used in the market rate analysis.

not go down even though there is a dip in market rates.  Because of our concern for quality we attempt to keep our market rates at the current 75th percentile.  As a rural state it is important to have a rate that providers in all areas of the state will be willing to accept children with subsidy payments       1       0       0       0       0                                                                                                                                                                                                               1       1       1       1       1       1      -1       1       1       0       0       1       0       0       0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Preschool age and school age rates are the same                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                    0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Providers are 'held harmless'  meaning that even if the market rates goes down in a category for their county from the last market rate, we do not lower the rate.  We set the mimimum market rate for infants at $140 per week.  Rates for toddlers are lower than infants, preschooler lower than toddlers, etc.

    The figure in c4b essentially represents the non-responses (i.e., the survey was mailed to the individual but not returned - guess that could be interpreted as a 'refusal to answer').  The figure in c4c includes some (but not all) of the surveys that could not be delivered as addressed.  Basically, we sampled 4,972 and received responses 3,281 (with the working database including 3,173 completed surveys).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            20050429The final report for the 2005 market rate survey is completed, pending distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  -1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1       1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1Frequencies were run and outliers identified and removed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1       1       1       0       1       0       1       1       1       0                                                                                                                                                                 1       1       1       1      -1      -1       1       1       1       1       1Unable to discern the 'no-fee' programs from others in the databse.

Data analysis was completed approximately 4-5 months later using our methodology in place at that time. The analysis was longer than usual due to a legislative audit. Data analysis typically takes approximately 2-3 months. Market rate surveys were also completed in 2005 and 2006.       1       1       3       3       3       3       5       1       5       1                                                                                                        Minnesota Child Care Resource & Referral Network                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Institute for Applied Research                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            4       4       3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       116000    2100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     44583           95000          257683The costs identified in question A7 above reflect actual expenditures for the 2004 rate survey.  This includes costs related to a legislative audit on the methodology used to set rates and a legislative report about cost conainment options tha the program went through in relation to this survey, which has not been part of the annual process.  The costs identified above do not include typical costs related to bulletin distribution and programming costs as there were not changes to rates based on this survey due to a legislatively mandated rate freeze in place at that point in time.  These costs are typically part of the annual rate survey process.         1                                                                                                                                                                                                                57900006       1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       -1      -1       1      -1                                                  -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                            -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1       1      -1       1       1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                                 1   11000       1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0                                                                                                                          1   99999                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1   99999       1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1   99999       1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    B3f and B3g are 'sometimes' for MN vs. a yes/no.

The survey questions focus on providers rates, hours of operation and capacity levels. The survey is conducted by R&R agencies, data collected is entered in NACCRRAware and then downloaded for analysis. At a different time of the year, the R&R agencies conduct an update survey where they gather updated information about providers other business policies. Also, periodically throughout the year, the R&R agencies conduct vacancy updates. While it appears as if the rate data is administrative data, it is in fact gathered through an actual full population market rate survey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1      -1       1       1      -1                                                                                                                                                            1       1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                              -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                      0                                                                                                                                                        On C1 - I wanted to respond 'both'    On C15 - I wanted responded 'No' because I interpreted 'accuracy' to mean verified by objective/parent source. Data checks were done by computer and hand to confirm data was within reasonable range. Outliers were confirmed or edited. Perhaps defining what is meant by 'accuracy' would help respondents?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1       1       1      -1      -1                            -1       1Preschool programs; school-based school age care programs; programs unavailable to the general public                                                                                                                                       3      -1      -1      -1       1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                             Licensed family child care rates were analyzed by provider and center rates were analyzed by slot.

Some of which included converting provider rates to other units of time, including hourly, daily and weekly.         1It compared the rates reported in the most current market survey whose results have been released (for us this is the 04 market rate survey) to the maximum rates in place at that time, which were based on data collected in the 2001 market rate survey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       approximately 68.4% of licensed family child care homes and 56.8% of child care centers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1There was questionable data entry of provider responses in two geographic areas.  This was problematic as the methodology was applied during analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1The methodology used to establish statewide maximum center rates was changed.                                                                                                                                                   Also during the same time period as analysis of the most recently completed survey, a program evaluation of the rate survey process was conducted by the Office the Legislative Auditor in MN.  This program evaluation resulted in multiple methodology adjustments as part of a refinement process.  The various results were not publicly released.  The methodology to be used in future analyses of market rate surveys has been adjusted based on the program evaluation process.       0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         A market rate survey was completed in Feb-April 2005 and analysis of the data collected is currently in process.

This section was a bit challenging to answer in the current environment in Minnesota.  We are in the midst of a rate freeze that has been in place for the last two years but we have continued to conduct market rate surveys and analyze the data collected.  This survey almost seemed to assume that the most recent survey was used to set the current maximum rates.  I'm not sure if this is the standard trend in most states or not.      It took longer than 15 minutes to complete because I found myself adding lengthy comments.  In some areas the comments field could have been longer allowing for greater explanation of responses.       1they were disseminated as part of a larger report to our Legislature rather than in our usual publication manner due to a freeze on current maximum rates.      -1                                                                                                 -1       1                                                                                                                                                                                                              1       1       1       1       1       1local agencies which administer the child care assistance program, tribes, advocacy organizations                               Normally, the results of the market rate surveys are released by our publication of the resulting maximum rates and inclusion in our federal plan process.  However, due to the freeze on maximum rates currently in place, the results of the most recently completed market rate survey were instead disseminated as part of a larger report to our Legislature on cost containment in the child care assistance program.      I think it would be good to know how a state defines the 'results' of the child care market rate survey.  Results could be interpreted in a variety of ways.                                                                                                                                                                                                    20050701                                                                               0For the purposes of this survey, the most recently completed market rate survey was conducted in Feb - April 2004.  The maximum payment rates set on 7/1/05 are for the most part a continuation of the rates set on 7/1/03.  These rates are based on the market rate survey conducted in October - December 2001.  Some of the maximum rates increased on 7/1/05 based on market rate data collected in the October - December 2002 survey.  We will be releasing new maximum rates effective on 1/1/06 that will be the lower of the rates effective on 7/1/05 x 1.75% OR the maximum rate based on the market rate survey conducted in Feb - April 2005.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1       1       1       1       1       1       0       0       0B       C       F       Provider concerns - access to providers.  Minnesota's maximum rates were frozen in 2003, 2004, and 2005. The 2005 Legislature authorized some increases in maximum rates in 2005. The 2006 Legislature authorized an across-the-board 6% increase of all maximum rates. Even though the overall budget remains tight, the Legislature has allowed maximum rates to increase to help parents gain access to a greater choice of providers.An evaluation by Minnesota's Office of the Legislative Auditor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1       0       1       1       0                                                                                                                                                                                                               1       1       1       1       1       1      -1       1       1       0       0       0       0       0       1family child care group homes have the same max rate as family child care homes.  school-age centers have the same max as centers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1       1       1       1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                    1Regional/Statewide rates are calculated and applied in counties without enough centers to calculate a maximum rate.  As of July 1 2005, counties with one or two centers have the possibility of being assigned the 100th percentile rate rather than a 75th percentile rate based on adequate provider responses depending on some circumstances.      There are enough licensed family child care providers in every county in Minnesota to set 75th percentile maximum rates.transportation, food and activity fees are only paid if the provider's rate for care is less than the maximum reimbursement rate and the fees are considered mandatory for all families in care not just families receiving child care assistance.In August 2005 we had maximum rates in place that were the 75th percentile of our 2001 market rate survey and some that were the 100th percentile of our 2002 market rate survey. In our release of maximum payment rates on January 1, 2006 we had maximums that were the 75th percentile of the latest survey in 2005, some that were the 100th percentile of the 2005 survey, some that were an increase of 1.75% of the 2001 75th percentile and some that were an increase of 1.75% of the 2002 75th percentile. The 2006 Legislature authorized an across-the-board 6% increase of the maximum rates in place beginning January 1, 2006.   Regarding type of care, licensed-family group homes are paid using licensed family home maximum rates. In-home and family, friends or neighbors care are paid at 80% of the licensed family home hourly rate. School-age centers and some school-age enrichment activities are paid at the center maximum rates. Special needs care is paid according to their type of provider or the child's documented need. Some cases are allowed to be paid at rates exceeding the maximum rate for providers who are serving children without special needs.

                   The sample frame was subdivided by county clusters (Urban, Trade Center, and Rural based on county population size) and type of facility (Family Child Care Home I, Family Child Care

Some responses outside the reasonable numberic ranges are possible, expected and allowed.  However, the office needs confirmation, through a second call or confrimation at the first call, that the responses given by the provider are correct where the numberical values of the responses are higher than the reasonable numberic maximum values.  If responses from the providers indicate existence of a valid new higher rate trends in comparison with the reasonable numberic ranges developed the contractor must provide this information to the office for reconsideration of the initially developed reasonable numberic ranges.  All the market rate values must be those supplied by the child care providers, while administering the survey instument.  The contractor will not, under any circumstances, change any of the market rate values supplied by the providers to reflect the xpected guideline numberic ranges. Internal consistency checks in the data includes and is not limited to the following: For a given provider, the rates for part-time care (less than 30 hours a week) for a given age category must not be more than full time care (more than 30 hours a week). For a given provider, the rates for older children must not be more than that for younger children. For a given provider, the rates for before school and after school separately should not be more than before and after school combined.       1       1       1       1       1       1       1       1       1       1                                                                                                                                                                 1       1       1       1       1       1      -1       1       1       1       1For school age, we ask for before school, after school and full time.                                                                                                                                                                               1Not defined                                                                                                                                                        1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1       1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                            1       1      -1      -1       1       1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                              -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -1      -1      -1      -1       1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                      0                                                                                                                                                        A lot of this infor is available through our licensing database (in reference to Q20) -

When then converted all rates into weekly, daily, part day and hourly.  Cont. below. If a provider stated their full time rate was expressed in an hourly rate we mulitplied their full time hourly rate by 40 hours.  If they expressed it in dayts, we multiplied by 5.  If it was expressed in months, we divided by 12.    Cont. from above:  Please note that if a child is in care full time we use the weekly rate.  All of the other rates are used only when care is less than 30 hours.

     The survey gather 'private pay' rates only, and the regulated family home provider is a segment of regulated providers created by the state.  Only a small percent of these providers also provide private pay services, and a majority of them charged private pay families the same rate they are paid by the state.  Consequently, not only was only a small number of useful surveys returned, but of those returned most of their rates were identical to the current state rate.

It is extremely challenging collecting pay rates from regulated providers that do not serve subsidized children.  A significant majority of Ohio's home providers have literacy issues that a mail-in survey does not and maybe can not address.  Limiting responses to predetermined rate categories forced many providers to  calculate a rate that fit the listed rate category as oppose to reporting the facilities rates.

                           1Market rate data were used to determine:  (1) percentage of slots statewide that can be purchased at the subsidy rate, and  (2) percentage of provider care by zip code that can be purchased at the subsidy rate. This measure was created to determine whether the amount of access varied by geographic location.    Rates were included for toddler care, full-time hourly and monthly, for both family and center care. Because toddler rates have been found to be the most representative of all age-group rates, they were selected as the basis for calculating child care accessibility.21.00%

As recently stated, we have terminated the contract with Clemson University and DSS in-house staff will conduct the next market rate survey. Because we have terminated that contractual arrangement, we do not have access to the raw data used in the 2004 market rate survey.

University since 1991 to conduct our market rate survey. Over the years there was little to no revisions made to the data collected from providers. WE have plans to include more detailed data collection in the market rate survey which will be completed by DSS in-house staff in the spring/summer of 2006.

the CCR&Rs changed in FY03.  Improvements in database design allow the CCR&Rs to collect more detail on child ages served and their corresponding provider rates.  As a result, making comparisons between the 2002 and 2004 reports is not possible.

Within the center data set, licensed centers, which are regulated, and religious exempt providers, which are considered unregulated, were combined.  The total population of the center data set was surveyed.    The family providers consisted of regulated and unregulated providers however the majority were regulated.  Within the family data set, the selection was based on the number providers within each FIPS location.  For FIPS with a small number of providers, all providers were surveyed.  A random sample was applied to FIPS locations with many providers.       1   99999       1                                                                                                          0                                                                                                                                This information is not available.

Within the center data set, licensed centers, which are regulated, and religious exempt providers, which are considered unregulated, were combined.  The total population of the center data set was surveyed.    The family providers consisted of regulated and unregulated providers however the majority were regulated.

The response could  be either monthly, weekly, daily or hourly. The rates were then standardized to a weekly rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1After standardizing the rate to a weekly amount, each provider's rates were examine to determine if their response appeared consitant.  For example, if there is a infant rate, is that rate greater than or equal to the toddler rate.  If there is a before and after school rate is it equal to or less than the sum of before school and after school combined.    Each localities rate were checked to see if rates were within range.  Outliers were reviewed and in those cases, providers were called to correct unusual responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1       1       1       1       0       0       0       0       0       0                                                                                                                                                                 1       1       1       1       1       1      -1       1       1       1       1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0                                                                                                                                                                   0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1       1       1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                           -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                              -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                      0The market rate survey is focused specifically on provider rates.

C16: Rate information for family homes is weekly and rate information for centers is monthly. Also, although we collect information from 'no fee' centers and centers serving a high proportion of subsidy children, we do not use those rates in setting subsidy rates.    C??: Question on rate information by age categories-- For family homes we ask for the age of each child and the rate charged--we do not collect information by rate categories at all. For family homes, the age categories you listed do not correspond to licensing categories for the toddler/preschool group. For centers we collect by age categories and the age categories correspond to those used in licensing regulations.

non-subsidized children using providers with rates below the DSHS subsidy rate (and willing to serve subsidized children) divided by all children. (This was just for full-time children.) For centers the same process was used, but the % DSHS was used to estimate children in each category.

The spreadsheets are emailed to the 72 county subsidy units. Counties send out the survey, collect the rate info and enter it into the the spread sheets. The spreadsheets are emailed back to the state. The state calculates the results and enters the max rate info into the subsidy payment system.                                                                                       0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            3       4       4Overall, I believe that the rate finding are accurate except in our biggest urban area, Milwaukee. There are indicators that the subsidy rates are inflated in that area.

If the percentage was <25, the provider's prices were excluded from the survey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1       0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                            1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                              -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -1      -1       1      -1      -1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                      0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1       1       1       1       1if over 75%                  1      -1Exclude programs not open to the public.

I indicate no in D3a, but to some extent we will in fact analyse data on a statewide level, especially non rate related questions.    We posses enough information (we know the county and zip codes of the respondents) and could do the data in othe ways.

Rates are set by region, and so a community that previously had no providers would still have its rates determined based on the region in which it was located.    Analysis based on quality, eduaction and other matter, including rates over time may be done from time to time, but it is not per se a part of the market rate Survey, but rather Market rate Survey in combination with other data would be used for such analysis.       0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Questions were asked in standardised units.

For many instances even switching to total universe reporting doe not solve the problem.  Since the problem is one endemic in Alaska's small poulation, I do not neccessarily view it as a methodological issue.                                                                                                                    0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0We hope to switch to universe reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1                                                                                                                                                                -1                                                                                                 -1       1Email                                                                                                                                                                                                        -1       1       1       1      -1      -1                                                                                                                                Our data could go onto our website at some time, but has not and historically has not.  Our reports, or at least some of them, will essentially be available to the public, in practical terms the only people we target to reach an are sure we do reach are our R&R, LA's and providers; in the case of the latter, it tends to be the larger providers taking an active interest.    Other groups are in general welcome to have access to information, and we would love to be reaching more people so as to educate them on childcare issues, but in practical terms the contact with people outside of the 'Childcare Community' is not good.  This is not because this office wishes to withhold information, but a reflection of the low priority our society places on childcare issues.20041226
