#Course Overview
Intro to Data Visualization for the Web is a 4 week intensive seminar style course design to take students from "A to Z" in data visualization concepts and implementation.  The course hinges heavily around d3.js, and brings in several modern work flow tools (like yeoman), language extensions (CoffeeScript, Sass), and modern Javascript frameworks (Angular).  The goal is to give students the confidence to build modern, browser based visualization applications at scale.

This course will be valuable for a range of experience levels.  The entire course will feature specialized skills from the intermediate to advanced level.  At a minimum, highly motivated students, should have introductory experience with JavaScript and an understanding of functional programming techniques.  However, most students will have a solid grasp of JavaScript fundamentals and object oriented programming.

#Course Objectives
1. Obtain strong theoretical understanding of data visualization techniques and approaches
1. Obtain firm grasp on modern tools and work flows for web based application development
1. Develop skill set to implement and lead data visualization projects 
1. Develop skill set for requesting, cleaning, and manipulating data
1. Understand business and product applications for data visualization
1. Obtain skills for presenting data visualization final products

#Expectations
* **Time Commitment:**  This class meets on Saturdays in November (11/1, 11/8, 11/15, 11/22) from 10AM-5PM.  Additionally, most weeks students should be devoting 5-10 hours a week outside of the seminar to topics covered.  Bottom line, in order to get the most out of this class, students should look at this course as a second job - one with great coworkers and no boss!

* **Location:** This class will meet in one of the Portland Code School Classrooms.  However, from time to time, we may meet outside of the classroom and attend local meetups, or meet with local tech companies.

* **Calendar:** You should have been invited to the PCS calendar.  Please make sure that this is synced with your personal calendar, as schedules may shift from time to time.

* **Contacting your instructor:** Feel free to email me anytime.  The best way to use email, is as a vehicle to set up a phone call or meeting in person.  When you email me, you will get an autoresponder with my number.  Feel free to call or text if you'd like to have a quick chat, or to set up another time to talk.  PROTIP: *Don't email code (ever).*  If you absolutely need to communicate some piece of code to me (or your peers) you should be sending a link to the line number of a commit on Github or at the very least to a gist.

#Resources
There are not any required text books for this course.  Documentation for the various technologies we are using will be the most helpful resources, as well as tutorials and links to popular stack overflow questions and answers.

#Computer
Every student is expected to have their own machine.  OSX tends to be the most popular operating system for web developers.  That being said any Linux system, if you are familiar with it, can provide almost the same level of work flow support.  Being a professional developer on a Windows machine is really challenging and not recommended.  This class will allot time for debugging issues that arise for any student.  However, if issues arising are the result of an issue uniquely related to poor Windows functionality, we will not devote any class time to these issues.  Additionally, you should have a text editor.  [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com) is the text editor we will reference and use in class.

#Success
Success in this class will look different depending on where you are coming from.  Are you a professional dev looking to enhance your skillset?  Are you newish to JavaScript and brand new to d3.js?  Are you a Junior developer hunting for your first full time gig?  No matter where you are coming from, there are a few things that every successful student will leverage:
* **Come prepared for class**:  The most beneficial and highest use of class time is to provide each other feedback on the things we are learning after initial exposure to the different topics.  Staying up to date with all the course requirements is a must.  Students will not be able to *catch up* in class.
* **Work with others**:  Most code, is not written in a vacuum.  Working on a team is actually (or should be) a highly interactive and social experience.  Learning to collaborate will with others in class will make the work easier, more enjoyable, and ultimately will be better preparation for "real world" software development.
* **Be creative**: Be creative and take ownership of the assignments.  If the assignment says "do y with x dataset", and you want to "do y with z dataset" go ahead.  The point is to put your passion into your work and learning in this course, and sometimes you have to be creative in figuring out ways to do this.
* **Relax**:  We are going to work on some hard problems.  In this course, chances are that (beyond the basics) you will rarely see the same problem multiple times.  Constant learning can be frustrating.  At the end of the day, it is just code.  If you put the time in, and take a long term view on your learning and the problems you are learning how to solve, you will walk away with skills you desire.

#Respect
This class depends upon an atmosphere of mutual respect for everyone involved. Together, we create a safe place to listen, learn, speak candidly, and fail safely. This is not a typical college class, it's a team effort producing learning outcomes and highly marketable job skills for everyone. You have the opportunity to make deep connections here that you will enjoy the rest of your career.

Students are expected to act at their highest capacity and with mutual respect for each other regardless of age, race, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, or prior experience. Instructors are expected to lead in this regard by example.

If you experience or perceive a problem, attempt to work it out on your own, if possible, but do not hesitate to bring it privately to the attention of your instructor.

#Student Projects
After getting some of the data viz basics under your belt, you will be asked to begin thinking about a final project that you can complete as an individual or with up to 3 people in a group.

Deadlines for the projects are mentioned in the class schedule. During the final week of class, students will present their completed projects to their fellow students, staff, and members of the Portland Code School employer network.
