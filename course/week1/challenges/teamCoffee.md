Companies to examine closer:
Navient - student loans. Follow up on stories about this company.
Ocwen - Mortgages. Compare it to market capitalization of other major mortgage lenders.
Encore Capital Group - Illegal actions. What does this catagory really mean?
Experian - complaints up substansial from 2012 - 2014. Why?

Added by BoRyan on 11/5:
* the data file manipulation was far less satisfying than I expected, since there were so few matches between the S&P500 and the consumer complaints data. I ended up doing some manual manipulation to at least get the top 14 complaint-generating public companies
* two files added:
  - top_complaint_companies.csv - marketcap and the total complaints for the top 14 complaint companies
  - consumer_complaints_with_marketcap.csv - adds marketcap field. only has complaints for the top 14 companies.
