# Overview
Using the skills you've built so far, start to take your own spin on one of the example visualizations from this week.  So far you know about:
    * manipulating selections (`selection.attr`, `selection.classed`, `selection.style`)
    * data binding
    * adding interactions (e.g. `selection.on('drag', somedragfunction`))
    * d3 svg built ins (e.g. `d3.svg.area`, `d3.svg.line`)
    * scales
    * ?

# Goal
Using the "Consumer Complaints" dataset from week 1 or the "Inequality Dataset" from this week, expand upon one of the examples.

You will present your work on the morning of the 3rd week.

# Challenge

* Set up a gist with your code to be viewed using [bl.ocks](http://bl.ocks.org).
* Using one of the existing examples, make it better, or make it yours, or make it better by making it yours ;-)
* Ideas:
    * Improve the UX for the "interactionsNFormatting Example"
    * Using one of the week two examples, use the `d3.svg.line` add 'lines' for all "segments" of the inequality dataset in different colors.  Don't forget a key!
    * Extend the stack layout example with transitions for when the data appears, as well as transitions on `mouseover` and `mouseout` for the different layers.
    * Turn the "Consuner_complaints" data set into a giant pie chart using the `d3.layout.pie`, or into a treemap using `d3.layout.treemap`
    * ?

# Deliverable

** IMPORTANT **
When you have finished your visualization, submit a pull request editing the [Deliverables.md](../Deliverables.md) file with your name, and a link to the visualization.  E.g.

```
