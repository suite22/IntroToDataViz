Notes applicable to this table:,,,,Data as of:Â 12-JUN-2014 ,,
"1. The source for this table is ACF-800 data for FFY 2012.  The ACF-800 is based on an annual unduplicated count of families and children; i.e., a family or child that receives one hour of service on one day is counted the same as a family or child that receives full-time care throughout the fiscal year.",,,,,,
"2. All percentages are based on ""adjusted"" numbers of families and children, unless otherwise indicated. These ""adjusted"" numbers represent the number funded through CCDF only (which includes Federal Discretionary, Mandatory, and Matching Funds; TANF transfers to CCDF; and State Matching and Maintenance of Effort Funds). The ""adjusted"" number is the raw or ""unadjusted"" number reported by the State multiplied by its pooling factor, as reported on the ACF-800.  This report takes this factor into consideration in calculating the ""adjusted"" numbers or percentages.  ",,,,,,
"3. A ""0%"" indication often means the value is less than 0.5% rather than actually zero.  In a few instances, the sum of the categories may not appear to add up to exactly 100% because of rounding.",,,,,,
"4. At the time of publication, all States and Territories had submitted their ACF-800 data for FY 2012.",,,,,,
