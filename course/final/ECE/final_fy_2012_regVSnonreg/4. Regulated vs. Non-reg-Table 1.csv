Notes applicable to this table:,,,,Data as of:Â 12-JUN-2014 ,,,
1. The source for this table is ACF-801 data for FY 2012. ,,,,,,,
"2. All percentages are based on ""adjusted"" numbers of families and children, unless otherwise indicated. These ""adjusted"" numbers represent the number funded through CCDF only (which includes Federal Discretionary, Mandatory, and Matching Funds; TANF transfers to CCDF; and State Matching and Maintenance of Effort Funds). The ""adjusted"" number is the raw or ""unadjusted"" number reported by the State multiplied by its pooling factor, as reported on the ACF-800. This report takes this factor into consideration in calculating the ""adjusted"" numbers or percentages.",,,,,,,
"3. A ""0%"" indication often means the value is less than 0.5% rather than actually zero.  In a few instances, the sum of the categories may not appear to add up to exactly 100% because of rounding.",,,,,,,
"4.   At the time of publication, all States and Territories had submitted the full 12 months of data for FY 2012. ",,,,,,,
"5. Some children are reported to have multiple settings for the same month.  Children in more than one setting category within the same month were counted in each setting in proportion to the number of hours of service received in each setting.  For example, if the child spent 70 hours in a center and 30 hours in a child's home, the child would be scored as 0.7 count in Center and 0.3 count in Child's Home (proportional counting). ",,,,,,,
"6. For consistency between related reports involving setting data, children with invalid or missing data for care type, hours, or payment for any setting(s) are reported in the Invalid/Not Reported category.",,,,,,,
