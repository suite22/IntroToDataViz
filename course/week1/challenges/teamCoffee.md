Bubble map of companies - https://public.tableausoftware.com/views/Consumer_Complaints_dataset/Companies_Bubble?:embed=y&:display_count=no

Companies to examine closer: // Updated 11/6 by Ben
* Navient - student loans. Follow up on stories about this company.
* Ocwen - Mortgages. Compare it to market capitalization of other major mortgage lenders.
* Encore Capital Group - Illegal actions. What does this catagory really mean?
* Experian - complaints up substansial from 2012 - 2014. Why?
* Bank of America - even factoring in their market cap, they still get far more complaints than other companies their size
* Nationstar Mortgage - similar complaint level to Ocwen.

Added by BoRyan on 11/5:
* the data file manipulation was far less satisfying than I expected, since there were so few matches between the S&P500 and the consumer complaints data. I ended up doing some manual manipulation to at least get the top 14 complaint-generating public companies
* two files added:
  - top_complaint_companies.csv - marketcap and the total complaints for the top 14 complaint companies
  - consumer_complaints_with_marketcap.csv - adds marketcap field. only has complaints for the top 14 companies.

Added by Ben on 11/6:
* So now the question is: Which of these companies stand out when you compare their complaints to their market cap?
- Answer! It's not quite as dramatic as I was hoping for, but you can definitely see Ocwen break away from the trend line of most of the other companies.

- Nationstar Mortgage also trends out of line with most of the other companies. 
- And even though we wanted to write off the numbers on Bank of America just because they're a huge company, they're also hugely complained about.
