230	White Earth Ojibwe Reservation Minnesota	 	Just that child care providers must charge the same rate to families, whether they are on child care assistance or not	 	We used the State's CCR&R data, randomly called providers/centers in our service area and contacted the county social services in our area and recieved their rates.  Staff and some advisory board members compared all the data and set our rates accordingly.	 	This is an estimated cost, which I think is on the high end.	Staff time, advertisements, meetings/networking, referrals, phone, internet, technical assistance and quality improvement.	Within our Tribal program, we have staff that share in the CCR&R services that we offer that are integrated throughout our program services.	With our subsidy program, we have families that still use relative care and sometimes we feel it is not the best care.  We do require criminal background checks on all unlicensed as well as offer health & safety training, child development training, but many choose not to participate in quality initiatives.  There is a huge need for part-day care.  Many Head Start and school age children don't have a place to go, because most licensed cc providers choose to take full day children.  Head Starts need to start helping with before and after school initiatives within their centers, as parents will choose to keep their children in full day child care and not send them to HS.	It is important to provide information to the general public about the expense of child care to working families.  On the flip side of that, how our child care providers are working with low hourly wages with no benefits.....	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Rural market rates surveys tend to reflect lower rates than the metro-based market rates surveys. It is hard for rural providers to raise their rates to be even comparable to metro-based cc provider rates, because, once they do, they may loose families to unlicensed care, as parents arent' accustomed to paying higher rates.  It is important to raise the issue of the cost of cc to the general public.	we used all of the above, but can only check one

AK2	Alaska	 	 	 	 	 	Assumes about 2 months' worth of Research Analyst time ($10,000) and the sum of other peoples' efforts in the Division to be equal to the time of the Research Analyst. The contractor who did the telephone survey was paid $8,750. Expenses the Child Care Resource and Referral agencies might incur in using the MRS data or doing further analysis is not included in the expense estimate.	 	 	A 2 on the first question because State set rates are considerably lagging the actual rates charged by providers.    A 4 on the second, because Alaska's percentage of eligible families served is fairly high compared to many other States, even if we can not reach all families at 85% of State Median Income.    A 3 on the third question because subsidy children are distributed across a wide spectrum of providers, just as are non subsidy children, and so we believe the care received by subsidy children is much the same as that for non subsidy children.	In a very small population state like ours, attempting to reach the whole population rather than sampling may prove more efficient and effective. Our entire universe of providers may in many instances be much smaller than the samples drawn in larger population states.	 	 	 	 	 	 	Does not include military centers (exempt from our regulations, but possible to obtain subsidy). Could include family child care providers that are located on a base.	There is just 1 Indian reservation in Alaska and it has 1 center, which is in the data set. Tribal Organizations provide their own subsidies to providers. Some Tribes certify their own providers, but if a provider cares for more than 4 children and any one of the children is not a relative of the provider, the provider is regulated by the state.	Alaska is unusual in that it has Native Corporations and Tribal Organizations, rather than reservations. The only Indian reservation that exists has its providers subject to state regulation.	The universe of providers in Alaska would be a small sample for many other states. Our methodology would not perhaps withstand the rigors that someone else might impose. Given the very small number of providers, the methodology of calling a provider N times, at a variety of times of day/days of the week, and then abandoning efforts after N times would have resulted in a very small sample (unless N was set at infinite), because our contractor would have exhausted his list of potential respondents very quickly with very few responders. Effort was spent beyond that to increase the number of completed surveys, but such efforts might be interpreted as giving certain respondents greater weight in the survey (a higher probability of having been captured), but the alternative would have been a very small sample size and many cells (by region and provider type) with little or no data.	 	 	 	The survey was not piloted per se, but the methodology was essentially the same as in prior years. The 2005 contractor had done the work in at least one prior year. The questions were essentially the same as the year before, although the survey was much shorter, i.e., many questions were deleted from the prior year's survey.	 	Only 27 providers explicitly refused to participate.  105 others had disconnected phones, said it was the wrong number, said they were no longer in business, did not speak english...etc    That leaves 211 for whom either there was never an answer to the phone calls (rings but no answering machine or person ever answers), messages were left but no call backs, the person said call again over and over or said they would call back and did not.  Although this counts 4 providers for whom their was no phone number in our database.    I conted 211-4=207 plus 27 explicit refusals as non responders, so 410/644 is our response rate.    Of course, some of the 234 Non respondents are in fact no longer in business and should not have been part of the sample/universe.  Some of the 109 that I say should not have been part of the sample, were actually in fact just refusing to participate.	Not sure what the discrepancy between this question and A3.  6/28/05 is the postmark on the email from the providerthat contained the final survey data, which from my point of view was when it was completed.  I would speculate that they may well have conducted their last survey somewhat earlier.	 	 	Small providers (licensed homes) might complete the survey in a few minutes. Large facilities might take a good deal longer. The contractor initially estimated about 15 minutes per survey, but found it was frequently taking longer, sometimes much longer for the bigger providers. In addition to questions regarding rates, our survey asked questions about employees. And so, for homes with just an owner operator, the survey was quite short. Centers frequently needed to gather information, and may well have spent more time than the length of the phone conversation would suggest.	 	We interpret School-age School Year as Part Time, School-Age Summer as full time, but respondents were supposed to answer the questions based on April 2005.	 	 	 	 	In general we weight rates by reported enrollment/attendance (not capacity), but might look at it other ways as well.    Various other questions not related to rates were asked, and typically would be reported with the provider as the unit of measurement.    We stratified our sample by provider type, and data is frequently reported by type: Center, Group Home, Licensed Home.	I indicate no above, but to some extent we will analyze data on a statewide level, especially non-rate related questions. We possess enough information (we know the county and zip codes of the respondents) and could analyze the data in other ways.	Rates are set by region, and so a community that previously had no providers would still have its rates determined based on the region in which it was located.    Analysis based on quality, eduaction and other matter, including rates over time may be done from time to time, but it is not per se a part of the market rate Survey, but rather Market rate Survey in combination with other data would be used for such analysis.	Questions were asked in standardised units.	The percentile ranking of the state rates serves as a measure of market access for subsidy children.	I have mentioned the issue of our relatively small Universe of Providers, but that issue is a problem endemic in Alaska data do to our small population.  For many instances even switching to total universe reporting doe not solve the problem.  Since the problem is one endemic in Alaska's small poulation, I do not neccessarily view it as a methodological issue.	 	 	Our data could go onto our website at some time, but has not and historically has not.  Our reports, or at least some of them, will essentially be available to the public, in practical terms the only people we target to reach an are sure we do reach are our R&R, LA's and providers; in the case of the latter, it tends to be the larger providers taking an active interest.    Other groups are in general welcome to have access to information, and we would love to be reaching more people so as to educate them on childcare issues, but in practical terms the contact with people outside of the 'Childcare Community' is not good.  This is not because this office wishes to withhold information, but a reflection of the low priority our society places on childcare issues.	 	 	 	 	 	Once again, rates were set by geographic region, s a community with no providers had its rates set, so that should a provider appear in a community where there had previously been none, we would know what rate was applicable.

Comment on response to Q# B3b1:  This number reflects the total number of family child care providers who choose to register with the CCRR.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Comment on response to Q# C2: While the most recent survey was not field tested, a field test had been conducted on the survey instrument at a previous point in time.    Comment on response to Q#C4c.  In addition to providers who refused to participate in the survey, the difference between C4a. and C4c is due to providers subsequently being dropped from the survey population due to reasons such as: currently not providing care to children; not charging for child care; not having a valid telephone number, etc.    Comments on responses to Q# C16:    Specific rate information was not collected from providers on Non-standard hours care; however provider were asked if Non-standard hours care was provided.    For School-age rates, information was collected but not broken down by school year and summer.  Rather data was collected by full and part day from which specific program time period rate could be inferred.    Comments on responses to Q# C18:  Under Provider Infomation, instead of Licensed capacity for children, our survey question was 'How many children do you have approval to care for?'    Under Provider/Caregiver Characteristics, 'Center based provider education level, training level, wages and benefit level; Information was not collected in our Market Rate Survey.  It was however collected in a survey funded by a different state agency.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Comment to response to Q# D1: No-fee centers were excluded from the survey and therefore also excluded from the rate analysis.    Comments to responses to Q#D3:  Regions included county clusters as well as individual counties in some instances.    Related to 'school-age school year' and school-age summer'; see comments to Q# C16.    Comments to Q# D4: Rates in limited markets such as rural areas were analyzed not separately; but were indeed analyzed due to the very nature of our state's geographic regions.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Comments on responses to Q# F6:  Re: Region - see commnet to Q# D3  Re: school-age school year, school-age summer - see comment to Q#C16.    General survey comments:  It would have been convenient to have a comment section available after every question.    It would be helpful to be able to go back to the beginning of a section with a single key stroke as opposed to having to page back one page at a time.    For individuals who were inputting/responding to more than one section, it would have been convenient to only have to 'log in' once as opposed to multiple times for each section.    Question?  Since a 'Field-Test Version' (such as this) was completed, will it be necessary to complete another survey when it goes out to all states?

Rates were based on the number of respondents, not the price.	Prior to the Budget Act of 2003-04, the ceilings for licensed programs were set at 1.5 standard deviations above the mean.

KS1	Kansas	 	 	 	Kansas used KACCRRA (the R&R Network) data for the 2004 market rate survey because it is rate information that providers give to R&R's for the purpose of receiving referrals and business.

Unable to provide this information as existing staff was used at both the KACCRRA and state agency & I have no way of factoring out the expense of the time spent on this survey.	 	 	Kansas has not increased provider rates since 2002.  As a result many child care providers, especially centers are no longer serving infants and toddlers receiving subsidy payments.

If the facility is regulated by the State through KDHE (Ks Dept of Health and Environment), they are included in the dataset.	 	 	Market rate information is collected from regulated Family Child Care and regulated Child Care Center facilities only.	Kansas has 16 Resource and Referral agencies, each maintaining a database for their SDA.  All regulated providers are listed in their database.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	The rate information is downloaded by service field.  We have not determined the number of providers who do not respond, only the number per service field who do respond.  The responses may or may not be duplicated by facility.	Full time rates may be entered by hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly rates.  Part time rates are entered only at an hourly rate.	 	School age care through Family Child Care providers and Child Care Centers are included at an hourly rate and were indicated as full time or part time.  Programs regulated at School Age Programs were not included in the rate information.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Rates paid for Relative care were decreased.	Relative Care

Information on market rate is collected on a continual basis as part of a provider update questionnaire that is sent out annually. About 50% of providers have returned a questionnaire within the current survey year.  All reported fee information is used in the market rate analysis. The questionnaires are distributed and collected by local CCRR's, then forwarded to the state coordinating agency, Maryland Committee for Children, which does all data entry, data maintenance, and analysis and reporting.	 	 	 	 	 	 	This is the date that provider data for fiscal year 7/2004-6/2005 was 'frozen' for analysis.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Our payment rates were set at the 75th percentile of the 2001 market rate survey.  Therefore, due to rising cost of child care, they are now below that percentile based on the 2005 market rate survey (which is the most current one).

The results are presented to the Maine Child Care Advisory Council.	 	 	 	 	Preschool age and school age rates are the same	 	Providers are 'held harmless'  meaning that even if the market rates goes down in a category for their county from the last market rate, we do not lower the rate.  We set the mimimum market rate for infants at $140 per week.  Rates for toddlers are lower than infants, preschooler lower than toddlers, etc.
MI1	Michigan	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Have not fully reviewed	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	The sampling methodology from the state's 2002 market rate survey was used in 2005:  random sample of up to 13 providers from each of five provider types (for up to 65 providers per county).	 	 	 	The 2005 survey was a variation of the 2002 survey.	 	The figure in c4b essentially represents the non-responses (i.e., the survey was mailed to the individual but not returned - guess that could be interpreted as a 'refusal to answer').  The figure in c4c includes some (but not all) of the surveys that could not be delivered as addressed.  Basically, we sampled 4,972 and received responses 3,281 (with the working database including 3,173 completed surveys).	The final report for the 2005 market rate survey is completed, pending distribution.	 	 	 	 	Unable to discern the 'no-fee' programs from others in the databse.  This is something to be worked on for the next MRS.	 	 	Again, next time around, we plan on revising the survey to allow the identification of the 'no fee' programs such as 'Headstart' and school readiness programs.	 	 	 	We strictly analyzed rates by full-time and part-time, both hourly and weekly.	d5:  no conversion necessary; we asked for hourly rates, half day rates, full day rates, and weekly rates	We did present rate information at the 75th percentile.	The 2005 analysis was more detailed than the 2002 analysis:  included weekly rate discussion and differentiated between part-time and full-time rates when differences were statistically significant.	The final report has recently been completed (this week); pending distribution.  All comments relate to the 2005 MRS.	 	The final report was recently completed and will be distributed to the legislature and Federal Government shortly.	 	Date unknown 97-98	 	 	Reduced relative payment rates to 65% of the registered family home payment rates.  A statewide rate was established for in-home (in the child's home) care.	Rates were collected from resource and referral databases and counties clustered by similar rates.	 
MN2	Minnesota	 	 	The market rate survey used for this survey was completed on 4/15/2004. Data analysis was completed approximately 4-5 months later using our methodology in place at that time. The analysis was longer than usual due to a legislative audit. Data analysis typically takes approximately 2-3 months. Market rate surveys were also completed in 2005 and 2006.	 	 	The costs identified in question A7 above reflect actual expenditures for the 2004 rate survey.  This includes costs related to a legislative audit on the methodology used to set rates and a legislative report about cost conainment options tha the program went through in relation to this survey, which has not been part of the annual process.  The costs identified above do not include typical costs related to bulletin distribution and programming costs as there were not changes to rates based on this survey due to a legislatively mandated rate freeze in place at that point in time.  These costs are typically part of the annual rate survey process.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	B3f and B3g are 'sometimes' for MN vs. a yes/no.    Also - the population for these questions cannot be answered because some may be regulated by both the tribe and the state.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Minnesota conducts a full population market rate survey. The survey questions focus on providers rates, hours of operation and capacity levels. The survey is conducted by R&R agencies, data collected is entered in NACCRRAware and then downloaded for analysis. At a different time of the year, the R&R agencies conduct an update survey where they gather updated information about providers other business policies. Also, periodically throughout the year, the R&R agencies conduct vacancy updates. While it appears as if the rate data is administrative data, it is in fact gathered through an actual full population market rate survey.	 	On C1 - I wanted to respond 'both'    On C15 - I wanted responded 'No' because I interpreted 'accuracy' to mean verified by objective/parent source. Data checks were done by computer and hand to confirm data was within reasonable range. Outliers were confirmed or edited. Perhaps defining what is meant by 'accuracy' would help respondents?	 	Licensed family child care rates were analyzed by provider and center rates were analyzed by slot. Minnesota's current methodology uses a center's licensed capacity if the center fails to supply their desired capacity.	Licensed family child care home and family child care group home were grouped together during our analysis.	We examined a variety of different analysis rules as part of a program evaulation process.  We did develop a different set of analysis rules that will be used in future market rate survey analyses.	As previously mentioned, we examined a number of different approaches to analysis.  Some of which included converting provider rates to other units of time, including hourly, daily and weekly.	 	Also during the same time period as analysis of the most recently completed survey, a program evaluation of the rate survey process was conducted by the Office the Legislative Auditor in MN.  This program evaluation resulted in multiple methodology adjustments as part of a refinement process.  The various results were not publicly released.  The methodology to be used in future analyses of market rate surveys has been adjusted based on the program evaluation process.	A market rate survey was completed in Feb-April 2005 and analysis of the data collected is currently in process.  For purposes of this survey, the most recently completed market rate survey is the one conducted in Feb - April 2004.	This section was a bit challenging to answer in the current environment in Minnesota.  We are in the midst of a rate freeze that has been in place for the last two years but we have continued to conduct market rate surveys and analyze the data collected.  This survey almost seemed to assume that the most recent survey was used to set the current maximum rates.  I'm not sure if this is the standard trend in most states or not.      It took longer than 15 minutes to complete because I found myself adding lengthy comments.  In some areas the comments field could have been longer allowing for greater explanation of responses.	Normally, the results of the market rate surveys are released by our publication of the resulting maximum rates and inclusion in our federal plan process.  However, due to the freeze on maximum rates currently in place, the results of the most recently completed market rate survey were instead disseminated as part of a larger report to our Legislature on cost containment in the child care assistance program.      I think it would be good to know how a state defines the 'results' of the child care market rate survey.  Results could be interpreted in a variety of ways.	 	For the purposes of this survey, the most recently completed market rate survey was conducted in Feb - April 2004.  The maximum payment rates set on 7/1/05 are for the most part a continuation of the rates set on 7/1/03.  These rates are based on the market rate survey conducted in October - December 2001.  Some of the maximum rates increased on 7/1/05 based on market rate data collected in the October - December 2002 survey.  We will be releasing new maximum rates effective on 1/1/06 that will be the lower of the rates effective on 7/1/05 * 1.75% OR the maximum rate based on the market rate survey conducted in Feb - April 2005.	 	Provider concerns - access to providers.  Minnesota's maximum rates were frozen in 2003, 2004, and 2005. The 2005 Legislature authorized some increases in maximum rates in 2005. The 2006 Legislature authorized an across-the-board 6% increase of all maximum rates. Even though the overall budget remains tight, the Legislature has allowed maximum rates to increase to help parents gain access to a greater choice of providers.	 	transportation, food and activity fees are only paid if the provider's rate for care is less than the maximum reimbursement rate and the fees are considered mandatory for all families in care not just families receiving child care assistance.	In August 2005 we had maximum rates in place that were the 75th percentile of our 2001 market rate survey and some that were the 100th percentile of our 2002 market rate survey. In our release of maximum payment rates on January 1, 2006 we had maximums that were the 75th percentile of the latest survey in 2005, some that were the 100th percentile of the 2005 survey, some that were an increase of 1.75% of the 2001 75th percentile and some that were an increase of 1.75% of the 2002 75th percentile. The 2006 Legislature authorized an across-the-board 6% increase of the maximum rates in place beginning January 1, 2006. Regarding type of care, licensed-family group homes are paid using licensed family home maximum rates. In-home and family, friends or neighbors care are paid at 80% of the licensed family home hourly rate. School-age centers and some school-age enrichment activities are paid at the center maximum rates. Special needs care is paid according to their type of provider or the child's documented need. Some cases are allowed to be paid at rates exceeding the maximum rate for providers who are serving children without special needs.

MT2	Montana	5 of 7 tribes have an agreement with Montana to license/regulate providers on respective reservations.	 	7/05/2005 survey is an interim effort, for informational purposed only.   Current rates are based on 6/30/2004 survey.  Most recent market rate survey was completed on 6/30/2006. Current rates, effective 7/1/2006, based on results from the 6/30/2006 survey results.	 	The Montana Early Childhood Advisory Council requested that an interim survey be conducted.	 	 	 	 	 	Montana's Child care Under the Big Sky (CCUBS) system incorporates licensing and subsidy programs.  The subsidy program is admisistered locally by CCR&Rs.	 	Unregulated providers are not partipating in the licensing or the subsidy programs.	Montana's Legally Unregistered providers are friends, family and neighbors.  They tend to accept the 'State rate'.  Survey results did not change over time.	 	 	No, our two military base providers are out of our licensing jusidiction.	Again, 5 of 7 tribes have agreements with Montana's licensing program.	 	 	Postcards are mailed by the lead agency and they are returned to the CCR&R, who may follow up by phone.	 	CCR&R enter rate information on the same system used to license/register providers.	 	 	 	 	Each provider receives a letter and a prepaid reply postcard.  CCR&Rs call to remind those who have not responded.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Providers are required to provide hourly and daily rates.

The above questions are worded differently and in a different order than the printed survey used to collect answers for your on-line survey.  This could potentially lead to reporting errors.	The survey asks for enrollment and payment data for private-paying children only.	 	 	 	 	 	Inconsistent wording	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	You listed additional options on the on-line version not included on the print version, such as 'Family, friends or neighbors' under F6c and 'Don't know' under F6c1.

Within each subframe a random sample was selected. In some subframes the entire group was surveyed because of the low number of facilities within that subframe. The total overall sample size was 896 for the 2005 Market Rate Survey.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	D3d: Weekly and monthly rate data were collected but not analyzed because Nebraska only uses hourly and daily rates. Weekly rates were used if daily data was not provided. See D5a and D5b.

Although no substantive changes are anticipated, release is pending final approval.  All of the responses in this section tell how the market rate survey WILL BE disseminated.	 	Maximum rates were increased due to a 1.5% Cost of Living Adjustment for the State budget period beginning July 1, 2005.	 	 	They are set lower than licensed providers.	Determined by the survey.

NY1	New York	 	 	New notes have been promulgated based on this survey.	 	 	 	Please note that this had nothing to do with market rate survey.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Survey is the same as used in previous cycle. Was field tested then.	 	Please note that the contract required that 4827 successful surveys be completed -  with the sample meeting the stratification requirements.	 	 	 	 	 	For school age, we ask for before school, after school and full time.	 	 	A lot of this infor is available through our licensing database (in reference to Q20) -  but we did not formally corss walk it with the market rate sample data.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
OH2	Ohio	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	The survey gather 'private pay' rates only, and the regulated family home provider is a segment of regulated providers created by the state.  Only a small percent of these providers also provide private pay services, and a majority of them charged private pay families the same rate they are paid by the state.  Consequently, not only was only a small number of useful surveys returned, but of those returned most of their rates were identical to the current state rate.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	It is extremely challenging collecting pay rates from regulated providers that do not serve subsidized children.  A significant majority of Ohio's home providers have literacy issues that a mail-in survey does not and maybe can not address.  Limiting responses to predetermined rate categories forced many providers to  calculate a rate that fit the listed rate category as oppose to reporting the facilities rates.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Methodology employed for establishing regions was extremely challenging and not very well received.
OK2	Oklahoma	 	 	 	Both the lead agency and the University contractor have participated in cleaning, analysis, interpretation and diseminating results.  The University will primarilly focus on the macro level and the agency on a micro level based upon specific needs.

We did not exclude them, but we did some analysis on rates by percentage of subsidized children.	This was the first year that we sent out both English and Spanish questionnaires.  In the past they could be requested.  The number of Spanish language questionnaires returned increased from 62 in 2002 to 248 on 2004.	 	 	 	 	This year we asked only for weekly or what a provider would charge by the week.

SC2	South Carolina	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	We have recently ended our contractual arrangements with Clemson University. The next market rate survey will be completed in-house by DSS research and planning staff. Additionally, we are working on developing a new licensing Management Information System (MIS) which will capture rate information for all regulated facilities.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	As recently stated, we have terminated the contract with Clemson University and DSS in-house staff will conduct the next market rate survey. Because we have terminated that contractual arrangement, we do not have access to the raw data used in the 2004 market rate survey.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	SC has rates for age categories 0-2, 3-5 and 6-12.	 	 	SC contracted with Clemson University since 1991 to conduct our market rate survey. Over the years there was little to no revisions made to the data collected from providers. WE have plans to include more detailed data collection in the market rate survey which will be completed by DSS in-house staff in the spring/summer of 2006.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
TN1	Tennessee	 	 	 	 	 	The way we are set up I would have to pro-rate costs across my entire licensing staff, something I am not willing to do.	 	This is for R&R data only. Not rate data.	 	 	 	 	The data set does include licensed family child care providers but not exempt providers.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	We do not asked providers in the survey about subsidized care because the subsidy program is part of our overall child care database and we already have that information.	 	 	 	 	All rates were converted to weekly rates.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Prices were based on the information given even if it is a low price.  We set rates info from each county.	 
TX3	Texas	 	 	 	 	 	 	Funds do not go to the CCR&R Ntw Ld. Agency contracts w/ Tx. Health and Human Svcs. Comm.'s I&R Ntwk. (2-1-1 system).	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	However camps or other facilities with two-week terms are reviewed by a different agency and are not part of our sample.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	The survey is repeated each year, and each year we engage in some pilot testing.	We actually track about 20 'dispositions' that we assign to each call, telling us why we did or did not complete an interview. The 176 are "over dials." These providers never answered repeated calls; so they did not refuse to participate and were not "dropped from the sample".	 	 	 	The time for interviews varies a great deal according to facility type.	 	 	 	Regarding C18, an exclusion as described would eliminate most providers in the poorest areas.	In 2004 we also collected additional information on the financial basis of facilities and their desire for business-oriented training.	We also exclude 'drop-in' rates, excluding facilities that only provide 'drop-in' care.	 	 	 	In D5 converted to daily rate	We did not ask whether they accept subsidies, just who did actually receive subsidies.	 	 	 	All parties listed in question E2 have access to the TWC Web site and the State Plan which includes the Market Rate Survey results (Attachment 7, p. 82).  Four public hearings were held across the State on the 2006-2007 CCDF State Plan, and those public hearings were announced in press releases eight days before each hearing.	 	Maximum rates are set loclly by each of the the State's 28 local workforce development boards. The Lead Agency imposed a rate freeze on local Boards maximum rates in January, 2003 due to state budget constraints. The freeze on maximum reimbursement rates is still in effect.

Data collection by the CCR&Rs changed in FY03.  Improvements in database design allow the CCR&Rs to collect more detail on child ages served and their corresponding provider rates.  As a result, making comparisons between the 2002 and 2004 reports is not possible.  (see page 5 of 2004 Utah Child Care Market Rate Study, Utah Department of Workforce Services.)

VA2	Virginia	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	The annual amount for CCR&R funds is an approximate.	The survey was not designed to examine the proportion of families served nor the quality of child care. The question of proportion of families served is examined through other methods.    Questions of quality are addressd by the Division of Child Care and Development through on-going programs.  Additionally, the Division has traditionally selected the maximum reimbursable rate, or market rate, at a generous level to insure access to quality care for subsidy cases.	 	 	 	 	 	Center and family providers are separated so there was actually two different survey data sets.    Within the center data set, licensed centers, which are regulated, and religious exempt providers, which are considered unregulated, were combined.  The total population of the center data set was surveyed.    The family providers consisted of regulated and unregulated providers however the majority were regulated.  Within the family data set, the selection was based on the number providers within each FIPS location.  For FIPS with a small number of providers, all providers were surveyed.  A random sample was applied to FIPS locations with many providers.	 	This information is not available.

Although, it was not field tested for this survey, the instrument has been tested over time.	 	Of the 3,123 center providers surveyed, there was 91% response rate.  There were 3,156 family providers surveyed with 68% response rate	All completion dates are approximates	 	 	 	Providers were asked their rates for full time care for infant, toddler, pre-school and school age care plus before,after and before and after care. The response could  be either monthly, weekly, daily or hourly. The rates were then standardized to a weekly rate.	 	 	 	 	 	 	Daily and hourly rates are derived from the weekly rate.  The assumptions used to calculate the daily and hourly rates are based on previous survey results.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Rates were adjusted for infant, toddler, and pre-school but not for school age, before school, after school and before and after school.

WA1	Washington	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Also, we do not have a category of family home providers that are excluded from regulation. Basically, our sample is drawm from all regulated/licensed providers.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	No (they were incl. in the survey though they may be excluded from calculation of market rates-centers with 85 percent or more DSHS subsidized children were excluded and the rates charged all DSHS children in family homes were excluded (WA uses rate information for individual children for family home rates))	C15: Were rates checked for accuracy? Not sure what to say. We do ask providers to confirm rates that seem out of range. And we do internal consistency checks etc. to screen for peculiar rates and then we review interviewer notes to see if special circumstances apply....    C16: Rate information for family homes is weekly and rate information for centers is monthly. Also, although we collect information from 'no fee' centers and centers serving a high proportion of subsidy children, we do not use those rates in setting subsidy rates.    C??: Question on rate information by age categories-- For family homes we ask for the age of each child and the rate charged--we do not collect information by rate categories at all. For family homes, the age categories you listed do not correspond to licensing categories for the toddler/preschool group. For centers we collect by age categories and the age categories correspond to those used in licensing regulations.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
WI2	Wisconsin	 	 	Providers were surveyed during the month of September, the results were calculated and reported to the counties by early December 2004.	In Wisconsin, the state subsidy office runs queries from the licensing database listing the qualified providers to be included into the survey. The spreadsheets are emailed to the 72 county subsidy units. Counties send out the survey, collect the rate info and enter it into the the spread sheets. The spreadsheets are emailed back to the state. The state calculates the results and enters the max rate info into the subsidy payment system.	 	 	 	 	 	See operation memo 05-26 in regards to the survey process in WI. http://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/em/ops-memos/2005/default.htm	 	We include all licensed group and family programs that are open for public and care for children at least 5 hours/day, 5 days/week.	 	 	 	 	only if licensed by the state	if the program is licensed and open >5hrs/day, 5 days/week	 	When we calculate the results, we exclude providers who serve over 75% subsidized children.	 	 	 	 	 	the follow-up work varies from one county to another.	The survey form instructs providers to report weekly fees as they were in the month of July 2004.	 	 	Counties conduct the survey and collect the paper forms. I am unsure about C14.	weekly rate	 	We asked providers how many private pay children they served in the month of July. The we compared this number to the total capacity of the center. If the percentage was <25, the provider's prices were excluded from the survey.	 	 	 	 	Once again, we interpret School Age Summer to be full time, and school age School year to be part time.    I indicate no in D3a, but to some extent we will in fact analyse data on a statewide level, especially non rate related questions.    We posses enough information (we know the county and zip codes of the respondents) and could do the data in othe ways.    But overwhelmingly data is analysed by region.	Rates are set by region, and so a community that previously had no providers would still have its rates determined based on the region in which it was located.    Analysis based on quality, eduaction and other matter, including rates over time may be done from time to time, but it is not per se a part of the market rate Survey, but rather Market rate Survey in combination with other data would be used for such analysis.	Questions were asked in standardised units. What is the cost for full time weekly care.	The percentile ranking of the state rates in our mind serve as measure of market access for subsidy children.	I have mentioned the issue of our relatively small Universe of Providers, but that issue is a problem endemic in Alaska data do to our small population.  For many instances even switching to total universe reporting doe not solve the problem.  Since the problem is one endemic in Alaska's small poulation, I do not neccessarily view it as a methodological issue.	 	 	Our data could go onto our website at some time, but has not and historically has not.  Our reports, or at least some of them, will essentially be available to the public, in practical terms the only people we target to reach an are sure we do reach are our R&R, LA's and providers; in the case of the latter, it tends to be the larger providers taking an active interest.    Other groups are in general welcome to have access to information, and we would love to be reaching more people so as to educate them on childcare issues, but in practical terms the contact with people outside of the 'Childcare Community' is not good.  This is not because this office wishes to withhold information, but a reflection of the low priority our society places on childcare issues.	 	 	varied from county to county.
