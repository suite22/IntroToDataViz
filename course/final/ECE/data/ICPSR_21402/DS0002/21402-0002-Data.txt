The additional effort to access all providers would not be great compared to the effort in only reaching a sample.  The office has in past years been in a Sate of Flux with new databases being introduced, changed and so on, but I believe our energies would be better placed attempting to obtain the data and place it in our day in day out database.  This would eliminate the need for a contractor, and conserve internal resources as well, and allow the data more widespread and easier accessability.

Partcipation in the survey is voluntary and they could have chosen not to participate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Prior to the survey commencing, providers were notified by the Child Care Program Office via postcard and encouraged to partcipate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The range from high to low within each category was checked.  The principle problem expected was that some full time and part time rates might have been mixed in with eachother, due to the perceptions of the providers about what is full/part time varying from ours.  Also data was checked to make sure Full>=part>=day>=hour...howevre there is no requirement that part time say be half the full time rate, or a day 1/30th the monthly et al...in fact shorter units of care tend to have higher, and frequently very much higher, costs when one calculates out the equivalency on a full month full time basis.  Many providers are tring to steer clients into utilising conventional units of care, typically a full months enrollment, and rates for smaller/erratic units are frequently punitive to discourage their use.

Routinely, based on the percentile rank of State rates within the data.    i.e. if the state rate was below that of 5 providers and above that of 5 providers the stae rate would be at the 50th percentile, and we would consider that a measure of accessibality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               State rates tend to have dropped below the 50th percentile at this point.

Certain relatives (e.g. grandparents, aunts/uncles) may provide care, be unregulated and receive subsidies on behalf of eligible families.  They are paid a fixed rate which is currently set at 70% of the average actual subsidy payment made to regulated family child care homes in the spring of 2001.

There may be more than one price profile per county, but only one price profile per ZIP. Larer counties will have several profiles, while smaller counties may only have one or two. There will be seperate profiles for center based care and for family child care homes. Trustlined/relative care will be based on a percentage of the familiy child care home rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  www.dhs.dc.gov                                                                             Dept. of Education Letter to voucher contractors (Alternative Payment Programs) and to Family Child Care Home Networks subject to the RMR Survey (8/29/03), All-County Ltr (ACL 03-41) to CWDs 9/8/03  Voucher contractors (Alternative Payment Programs), FCCH Networks subject to the RMR Survey, and county welfare departments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         subcounty                                                                                                                                                                                               F6c.

Weekly rates were most prevalent.  When daily rates were not provided, weekly full-time rates were divided by 5 (days per week), and/or monthly full-time rates were divided by 20 (5 days per week, 4 weeks per month), and/or hourly full-time rates were multiplied by 10 (hours per day), to yield a calculated daily full-time rate.  In the event that more than one rate was calculated (e.g., if the provider reported both full-time weekly and monthly rates) but the calculated rates did not agree, the daily rate calculated from the weekly rate was given first precedence as the rate used in analyses, the daily rate calculated from the monthly rates was given second precedence, and the daily rate calculated from the hourly rate was given third precedence. There were a few exceptions to these rules.  In the event that a center provided full-time care for 4 days per week, the denominators for calculating daily from weekly and monthly rates was based on 4, not 5 days per week.  In the event that a center provided care for 35 or more hours per week and provided care for 4 or more days per week and accepted children only full-time but did not report full-time rates, part-time rates were substituted for full-time rates, and the conversion formulas described were applied to obtain a daily full-time rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1. Proper ID of outlying rates (ie- appropriate exclusion of rates that lie outside of 'reasonable' rates in the given geographical area/market. 2. The conversion of rates reported hourly, weekly, or monthly to a standard FT rate. Issues involved how many hours per day, days per week, days per month to use as a multiplier or denominator when converting to FT rates. 3. The conversion issue was a particular one when converting Before and After school programs to a daily full time rate given that BA programs are not by defenition full time. 4. While analysis at the slot level seems most appropriate, current analysis suggest that for family child care homes, analysis at the provider-by-age group level might be as valid or more valid. 5. Lower than desired data update rates by a few participating CCR&Rs.  Analysis and reporting of rates was based at the slot level exclusively                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1) minor adjustments will be made to CCR&R collection of data. 2)The strict utilization of daily FT rates as the standard mode is under consideration as a)at least the plurality of provider charge and report weekly rates; and b) conversion or rates to one standard introduces error. 3)Analysis of center rates may continue at the slot level whereas analysis of family child care rates may be conducted at the level of the provider for a particular age group.  4) We will conduct an analysis to see if providers not reporting rates and providers who were not contacted to update rates are different in important dempographic characteristics from those for whom rates are available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     presented at meetings and conferences                                                                                                                                                                  presented/distributed to State Child Care Advisory Council, provider associations and advocacy groups, focus groups of providers

Minnesota's current methodology does not examine part-day rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         It compared the rates reported in the most current market survey whose results have been released (for us this is the 04 market rate survey) to the maximum rates in place at that time, which were based on data collected in the 2001 market rate survey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       approximately 68.4% of licensed family child care homes and 56.8% of child care centers.There was questionable data entry of provider responses in two geographic areas.  This was problematic as the methodology was applied during analysis.

Regional/Statewide rates are calculated and applied in counties without enough centers to calculate a maximum rate.  As of July 1 2005, counties with one or two centers have the possibility of being assigned the 100th percentile rate rather than a 75th percentile rate based on adequate provider responses depending on some circumstances.      There are enough licensed family child care providers in every county in Minnesota to set 75th percentile maximum rates.

This range is adjusted as needed.  The download is analyzed for high and low rates.  CCR&Rs are asked to follow up with provider and make necessary corrections.  Data is cleaned of zeros, which should be null values.  Rates are compared to the previous survey results.

From contract: the contractor must develop expected reasonable numberical ranges in consultation with the office.  Some responses outside the reasonable numberic ranges are possible, expected and allowed.  However, the office needs confirmation, through a second call or confrimation at the first call, that the responses given by the provider are correct where the numberical values of the responses are higher than the reasonable numberic maximum values.  If responses from the providers indicate existence of a valid new higher rate trends in comparison with the reasonable numberic ranges developed the contractor must provide this information to the office for reconsideration of the initially developed reasonable numberic ranges.  All the market rate values must be those supplied by the child care providers, while administering the survey instument.  The contractor will not, under any circumstances, change any of the market rate values supplied by the providers to reflect the xpected guideline numberic ranges. Internal consistency checks in the data includes and is not limited to the following: For a given provider, the rates for part-time care (less than 30 hours a week) for a given age category must not be more than full time care (more than 30 hours a week). For a given provider, the rates for older children must not be more than that for younger children. For a given provider, the rates for before school and after school separately should not be more than before and after school combined.

When then converted all rates into weekly, daily, part day and hourly.  Cont. below. If a provider stated their full time rate was expressed in an hourly rate we mulitplied their full time hourly rate by 40 hours.  If they expressed it in dayts, we multiplied by 5.  If it was expressed in months, we divided by 12.    Cont. from above:  Please note that if a child is in care full time we use the weekly rate.  All of the other rates are used only when care is less than 30 hours.

This measure was created to determine whether the amount of access varied by geographic location.    Rates were included for toddler care, full-time hourly and monthly, for both family and center care. Because toddler rates have been found to be the most representative of all age-group rates, they were selected as the basis for calculating child care accessibility.21.00%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/children/childcare/main.shtml                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Child Care Stakeholder Groups                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               They are 7% less than licensed family providers except that if FFN providers meet the same training as licensed providers, they receive the same rate as licensed providers.

For example, if there is a infant rate, is that rate greater than or equal to the toddler rate.  If there is a before and after school rate is it equal to or less than the sum of before school and after school combined.    Each localities rate were checked to see if rates were within range.  Outliers were reviewed and in those cases, providers were called to correct unusual responses.
