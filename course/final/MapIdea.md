# Map Idea

1) Convert dataset of US cities with lat lon into JSON object
2) Draw dots on the map
- color based on population?
- grow size of circle to represent population?
-- only once you are under X number of records
- look into d3

Fade the dots in over time? Delay the draw so we can see what's happening? 
Somehow we have to find a way to speed up the process?
