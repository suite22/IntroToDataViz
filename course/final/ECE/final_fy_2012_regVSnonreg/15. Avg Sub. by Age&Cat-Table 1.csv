Notes applicable to this report:,,,,,Data as of:Â 12-JUN-2014 ,
1. The source for this table is ACF-801 data for FY 2012.,,,,,,
"2. Nationally, 0.9% of the children served with CCDF funds were excluded from the above table because either their age was missing or invalid or their setting information was invalid, due to out-of-range or missing care type, hours, or subsidy.",,,,,,
3. Subsidy is the amount paid directly to the provider by the State or Territory.  It does not include the family copay.,,,,,,
4. Average subsidy per month is based on sums of subsidies per month in categories divided by counts of children in categories as further defined below.  ,,,,,,
"5.  All percentages are based on ""adjusted"" numbers of families and children, unless otherwise indicated. These ""adjusted"" numbers represent the number funded through CCDF only (which includes Federal Discretionary, Mandatory, and Matching Funds; TANF transfers to CCDF; and State Matching and Maintenance of Effort Funds). The ""adjusted"" number is the raw or ""unadjusted"" number reported by the State multiplied by its pooling factor, as reported on the ACF-800.   This report takes this factor into consideration in calculating the ""adjusted"" numbers or percentages.",,,,,,
"6. All States provide an actual unadjusted count of families served each month.  For States reporting full population data, the number of child records reported each month were directly counted.  However, for States that only submit samples, the ratio of children-to-families was determined each month from the samples and then multiplied by the reported number of families to obtain an estimate of the unadjusted number of children served each month.  The unadjusted average number of families and children was obtained from the monthly numbers in the FY, as reported on the ACF-801 summary (header) record. ",,,,,,
"7. At the time of publication, all States and Territories had submitted the full 12 months of data for FY 2012.",,,,,,
"8. For children served by multiple providers, the child's count is proportioned based on the ratio of the monthly hours with each provider divided by the monthly total hours of service. The average hours and subsidies for each State-month combination are based on the sum of hours in each category divided by the sum of proportional counts in each category. The State's annual results are determined by calculating a weighted average of the monthly results where the weight was the ""adjusted"" number of children served in each month. The National results shown above represent a weighted average of the State's fiscal annual results, where the weight for each State is the average monthly ""adjusted"" number of children served in each State for the fiscal year.",,,,,,
9. Some States have been reporting the maximum number of hours authorized and/or dollars authorized rather than the actual number provided. ,,,,,,
