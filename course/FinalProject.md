#Overview
Every week you will be building upon your skills.  Manipulations to visualization apps that took 30 minutes or an hour, will take you minutes - Concepts that took hours to distill at the beginning of the course will be simple be the 4th week.

Using the skills you are learning, pick a data set and use visualization as the medium to tell its story.

A winning approach would be to begin building the app from Week 1.  Realistically, trying to build a scalable app as you are learning new skills may not be possible.  As mentioned above, you may find that in Week 4 you are rewriting aspects of your app, from the ground up, in 10% of the time it took you the first time.

One big advantage of starting early and beginning to work with the data is that you will let it roll around in your head (that is a technical term) for an extended period of time.  The insight on how you should approach layout, color, interaction, sizing, and text for your visualization will likely come when you are away from your text editor.

#Format
Visualizations should be a single page web app, and be in the format of a Github gist, that can be viewed with the bl.ocks.org gist viewer.  If you want to go above and beyond, and deploy on your own server, or gh-pages - do that!  At the very least, use bl.ocks.org so we can all access it.

When presenting.  You will have 10-15 minutes of time to use however you would like to "tell a story" about your data.  However, keep in mind that this will be a great piece for your portfolio and should love beyond the space where you are presenting it in person.  Additionally, good visualizations are simple and may have a lot of complexity in them, but they will hide that complexity for the end user allowing the insights to be communicated quickly and with power.

You can use your time in whatever way you feel most comfortable.  A strong approach may be to take 2-3 minutes of time where you "pitch" a well rehearsed overview of your app and its interactions, you spend another 3-5 minutes with an overview of your approach to getting the data and building the app (code), and then the remaining time for Q&A.

Groups will take a slightly longer amount of time (20-25 minutes), where all contributors share equally.

#Due Date
TBD - either the last Saturday (11/22) or the Tuesday evening that follows (11/25) right before Thanksgiving.

#Data
Feel free to find your own data set, or use one of the example data sets provided.

#Groups
You have the option of working with 1-2 other people, with two caveats:

1. These are minute applications.  It would be very hard to have multiple people working on different aspects of the application.  What may be more effective is if you pair program and each come up with slightly different versions of the viz, but that bear the teams overall approach.  At the end of the day, you do want something that YOU can show off.  Showing off code of a project on someone else's github account that you "worked on" is a non-starter in a job interview ;-).

2. Even if you choose to do something completely different than any one else (different data, different d3 layout, etc.) you need to find at least one other person to check in with.  Great things are not created in a vacuum, and you need to be actively seeking out the opinions of others.  Folks in this class are refreshingly intelligent, and so this is not too much to ask.
