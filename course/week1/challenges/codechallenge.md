# Overview
Data visualization is all about telling interesting stories with data.  Per Tufty, it is not the medium that should be interesting - whether it be a web page, mobile device, sculpture, or a written article.  Rather, it is the degree to which you meaningfully communicate the information and message you want to articulate.

# Goal
Using the "Consumer Complaints" dataset, develop a visualization that communicates   something meaningful.

** Note: ** * Keep in mind that you will be presenting these in the morning of the second week.  So, your "medium" for communicating your visualization will be you! *

# Challenge

* Set up a gist with your code to be viewed using [bl.ocks](http://bl.ocks.org).
* Use a call back to get the data you are interested in:
    * Use the d3 callback method `d3.csv` to grab the file
    * ** OR **
    * Use the d3 json method to grab only certain pieces of the data from the data.gov api.  Data docs [here](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database), API docs [here](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaintdatabase/technical-documentation/#field-reference)
* Use d3 to make selections
* Append SVG elements to the DOM and style them using the data

# Deliverable

** IMPORTANT **
When you have finished your visualization, submit a pull request editing the [Deliverables.md](../Deliverables.md) file with your name, and a link to the visualization.  E.g.

```
# Name - Link to Bl.ocks
Your Name - http://bl.ocks.org/your-gh-username/gist-id
```
