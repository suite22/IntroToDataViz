Notes applicable to this report:,,,,,,Data as of: 12-JUN-2014 ,
1. The source for this table is ACF-801 data for FY 2012.,,,,,,,
"2. All percentages are based on ""adjusted"" numbers of families and children, unless otherwise indicated. These ""adjusted"" numbers represent the number funded through CCDF only (which includes Federal Discretionary, Mandatory, and Matching Funds; TANF transfers to CCDF; and State Matching and Maintenance of Effort Funds). The ""adjusted"" number is the raw or ""unadjusted"" number reported by the State multiplied by its pooling factor, as reported on the ACF-800.  This report takes this factor into consideration in calculating the ""adjusted"" numbers or percentages.",,,,,,,
"3. All States provide an actual unadjusted count of families served each month.  For States reporting full population data, the number of child records reported each month were directly counted.  However, for States that only submit samples, the ratio of children-to-families was determined each month from the samples and then multiplied by the reported number of families to obtain an estimate of the unadjusted number of children served each month.  The unadjusted average number of families and children was obtained from the monthly numbers in the FY, as reported on the ACF-801 summary (header) record.",,,,,,,
"4. A ""0%"" indication often means the value is less than 0.5% rather than actually zero.  In a few instances, the sum of the categories may not appear to add up to exactly 100% because of rounding.",,,,,,,
"5.  At the time of publication, all States and Territories had submitted the full 12 months of data for FY 2012.",,,,,,,
"6. The ""Mean CoPay/Income"" columns exclude families with zero income because dividing by zero is undefined.",,,,,,,
"7.  The column labeled as ""Category A"" includes: families with zero income; families in Protective Services or families headed by a child; and families with invalid income or copay.",,,,,,,
"8. The ""Families with $0 Copay …"" category is the percentage of families that had a $0 co-payment and were not in Category A, divided by the count of all families. The sum of these three categories is 100%.",,,,,,,
"9. The results shown under ""Mean Copay/Income"" feature two different statistics, ""Including"" and ""Excluding"" $0 copay. The data analyzed for the ""Including Families with $0 CoPay"" category includes all families except those families in the ""Category A"" data, i.e. the total minus the Category A data. The data analyzed for ""Excluding Families with $0 CoPay"" includes only those families in the category ""Families with CoPay >$0 (and not in Category A).""  Alternatively, the data used for ""Excluding Families with $0 CoPay"" is all the family data minus those families in Category A and minus those families with $0 CoPay.",,,,,,,
"10. The National weighted values were determined by multiplying each State's average co-payment/income percentage by the adjusted number of children in each State, summing across the States and then dividing by the adjusted number of children served for the Nation.",,,,,,,
